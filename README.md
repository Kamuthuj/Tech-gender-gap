Using a survey that was done, the project aims to unravel the distrtibution of technology roles between males and females. I performed data cleaning as the dataset had incorrect data types and some few null values where i dropped them. I utilized python libraries such as plotly and matplotlib to create interactive visualizations. From the analysis, 81.8% were males, 16.3% females while the remainder wanted to be anonymous. The majority of the respondents were between the age of 25-29 years. Also evidently the males were predominantly the ones with higher education than females. The salaries ranges showed males earned more in the same roles (jobs) that females also did. 
Evidently the gender disparity in the tech industry is big and the females are hugely under-represented in the field.
